    <h1>Yaka privacy policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025-11-16</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Yaka mobile application ("we," "our," "us") manages your information. The Yaka mobile application is an interface (WebView) that displays the content of our web service at <a href="https://yaka.yajusta.fr/">https://yaka.yajusta.fr/</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information the mobile application does not collect</h2>

    <p>The Yaka mobile application is designed to be a simple gateway to our web platform. <strong>Therefore, the mobile application itself does not collect, record, process, or store any personal or non-personal information from its users on your device or on our servers.</strong></p>

    <p>Microphone access for voice input:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The mobile application may request permission to access your microphone. This access is <strong>strictly limited</strong> to the voice input (speech recognition) functionality integrated within the web interface displayed by the application.</li>
        <li>Audio captured via the microphone is <strong>directly processed by the mobile browser</strong> for conversion into text.</li>
        <li>The audio is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
        <li>The mobile application itself does not store audio recordings or voice data.</li>
        <li>You have control over this access and can revoke microphone permission at any time through your device's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The mobile application does not access any other sensitive features of your device (such as the camera, location, contacts, photos, etc.) and does not request any access permissions to them, unless strictly necessary for the operation of the WebView itself (e.g., network access to load web content).</p>

    <h2>2. Data processing by the web version</h2>

    <p>Since the mobile application displays the content of our website <a href="https://yaka.yajusta.fr">https://yaka.yajusta.fr</a>, any data collection, use, or sharing of information occurs on the web platform.</p>

    <h2>3. Changes to This Mobile Application Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this mobile application-specific Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>4. Contact Us</h2>
