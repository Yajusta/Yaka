### End-to-End Workflow Tests (`e2e-workflow.test.ts`)

#### Application State Simulation

The E2E tests use an `ApplicationState` class that simulates a complete application environment:

- **User Authentication**: Simulates admin and regular user roles

- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity throughout operations

#### Test Scenarios

1. **Complete Project Setup Workflow**
   - Simulates a real project setup from start to finish
   - Tests initial list creation, card management, and workflow customization
   - Validates the complete user journey

2. **Team Workflow Evolution**
   - Tests the evolution of a team's workflow over time
   - Simulates adding new lists, removing old ones, and migrating data
   - Validates long-term system usage patterns

3. **Error Recovery Scenarios**
   - Tests system behavior during API failures
   - Validates error recovery and retry mechanisms
   - Ensures data consistency after errors

4. **Concurrent User Operations**
   - Simulates multiple users working simultaneously
   - Tests race condition handling and data consistency
   - Validates system behavior under concurrent load

5. **Performance with Large Datasets**
